                  Fantastic pizza and awesome owners! We booked Katie & Elliott
                  for our wedding and the process and event was so easy to
                  organise. Everyone loved the pizzas and it made our day that
                  bit more special.

                  Flanco recently provided pizza for the evening of our wedding.
                  They were fantastic! Accommodating and helpful in the lead up,
                  and absolutely made the evening for us! We lost count of how
                  many guests have told us how delicious the pizza was
                  (especially the Underdog) - more than one said it was the best
                  they have ever had. Would 100% recommend them!

              Perfect sourdough crusts and great flavours. Have tried a wide variety of the toppings now and all have been great. The garlic pizza bread is AMAZING ðŸ¤©

              These pizzas are absolutely amazing!  Itâ€™s easy to order, and you always get quick responses to messages. But best of all the pizzas are out of this world!  We usually get them on a Thursday from Hangleton and are talking about it from Monday onwards. Itâ€™s the highlight of our week! Thanks for delicious food guys!
